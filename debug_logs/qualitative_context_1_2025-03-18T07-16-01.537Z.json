The exact hue can vary slightly based on the processing method and the purity of the oil, but it is generally regarded as a pale yellow to light green liquid. Borage oil is derived from the seeds of the borage plant and is rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), contributing to its nutritional properties.\n\n[DAILY SUMMARY: 3/18/2025 to 3/18/2025]\nBorage oil typically has a light yellow to dark green color, depending on its preparation and purity.
