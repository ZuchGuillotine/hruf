Given the consistency and absence of effects, it may be beneficial to reevaluate your supplement choices in consultation with a healthcare provider, especially concerning the potential addition of copper or fish oil for enhanced health benefits.\n\n[3/14/2025]\n### Supplement Log Summary for March 14, 2025\n\n**Supplements Taken:**\n1. **Creatine** - 5 mg\n2. **Borage Oil** - 1 g\n3. **Bacopa** - 1 mg\n4. **Zinc** - 10 mg\n5. **Boron Glycinate** - 5 mg\n6. **Vitamin B5** - 1 mg\n\n**Effects Recorded:**  \nAt no point during this day or in the past week have there been any recorded effects from the supplements taken. All supplements continue to yield \"no effects recorded.\"\n\n---\n\n### Recent Supplement History (Last 7 Days)\n\n- **Creatine**: 5 mg daily (March 9, 10, 13, 14) - No effects recorded\n- **Borage Oil**: 1 g daily (March 9, 10, 13, 14) - No effects recorded\n- **Bacopa**: 1 mg daily (March 9, 10, 13, 14) - No effects recorded\n- **Zinc**: 10 mg daily (March 9, 10, 13, 14) - No effects recorded\n- **Boron Glycinate**: 5 mg daily (March 9, 10, 13, 14) - No effects recorded\n- **Vitamin B5**: 1 mg daily (March 9, 10, 13, 14) - No effects recorded\n\n### User Health Profile\n\n- **Weight**: 210 lbs\n- **Height**: 67 inches\n- **Gender**: Male\n- **Date of Birth**: February 5, 1988\n- **Average Sleep**: 8 hours 30 minutes\n- **Allergies**: Apples\n\n---\n\n### Considerations for Copper Supplementation\n\n1. **Recommended Intake**: Approximately 900 micrograms (mcg) per day for adult males through both food and supplements.\n2. **Potential for Deficiency**: Supplements should generally only be considered if there's a known deficiency or imbalance, especially relative to zinc, as high zinc intake can inhibit copper absorption.\n3. **Balance**: It's common to see formulations that include both zinc and copper to maintain mineral balance.\n\n### Key Observations\n- No effects from the current supplement regimen suggest either the dosages may not be optimal or the supplements may not be well-suited to your specific health needs.\n- Monitor if incorporating copper may help maintain the balance with zinc if significant amounts of zinc are consumed regularly. \n\nOverall, consider reevaluating your supplement choices or discussing this with a healthcare provider to identify potential adjustments that can better suit your health goals.\n\n[3/14/2025]\n**Supplement Summary for Date: March 14, 2025**\n\n**Supplements Taken:**\n- **Creatine:** 5 mg, no effects recorded.\n- **Borage Oil (General):** 1 g, no effects recorded.\n- **Bacopa (General):** 1 mg, no effects recorded.\n- **Zinc:** 10 mg, no effects recorded.\n- **Boron Glycinate:** 5 mg, no effects recorded.\n- **Vitamin B5:** 1 mg, no effects recorded.\n\n**Recent Supplement History (Last 7 Days):**\nAll recorded supplements (Creatine, Borage Oil, Bacopa, Zinc, Boron Glycinate, Vitamin B5) were taken consistently at the same doses, with no effects observed on any day, including March 14. \n\n**Qualitative Observations:**\n- No noted changes in feelings or physical state correlate with this supplement regimen over the last week, indicating a lack of observable effects from the current dosages.\n\n**User Query Regarding Copper Supplementation:**\n- The recommended dietary allowance for copper is approximately 900 mcg per day for adult males. It's important to consider copper intake in relation to zinc supplementation, as high levels of zinc can affect copper absorption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The current supplement regimen shows no significant physiological effects based on user reports. Adjustments, including potential copper supplementation, should be discussed with a healthcare provider, particularly considering the existing supplements and overall mineral balance.\n\n\n\nUser Query:\nDoes this impact any of the other supplements i'm taking?\n\n"
