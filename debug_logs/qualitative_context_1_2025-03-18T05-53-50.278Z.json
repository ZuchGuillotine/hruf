The exact hue can vary slightly based on the processing method and the purity of the oil, but it is generally regarded as a pale yellow to light green liquid. Borage oil is derived from the seeds of the borage plant and is rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), contributing to its nutritional properties.\n\n[DAILY SUMMARY: 3/18/2025 to 3/18/2025]\nBorage oil typically has a light yellow to dark green color, depending on its preparation and purity. It is derived from the seeds of the borage plant (Borago officinalis) and may appear cloudy or clear, with the darker shades often indicating higher concentrations of certain fatty acids.
