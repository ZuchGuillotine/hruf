Thought about SendGrid integration troubleshooting for 19 seconds
Below is a list of common problem areas and possible issues to check for when troubleshooting why new user confirmation emails are not being sent via SendGrid. Even if some of these points seem obvious or are already addressed in your code, it’s worth verifying them carefully, given how easy it is for an environment or configuration detail to break the email flow.

1. Environment & Configuration
Missing or invalid SendGrid API key

Double check that SENDGRID_API_KEY is actually loaded from .env (or equivalent) into the process environment.
Make sure the key is the correct one associated with the correct SendGrid account.
Incorrect sender address or domain

Verify the sender or from address in server/utils/email.ts is properly configured and is an email/domain verified in your SendGrid account.
If you’re using a custom domain, ensure SPF, DKIM, and domain authentication settings are properly set in SendGrid.
Development environment variables

If you’re using different environment variables in dev vs. production, verify that each environment has the correct SendGrid credentials.
Make sure that NODE_ENV or other config logic isn’t accidentally disabling email in development.
2. Email Sending Logic (server/utils/email.ts)
Proper initialization of SendGrid

Ensure that sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY) is called once and before you attempt to send any emails.
Check for any error logs if the key is missing or invalid—SendGrid’s client often throws errors that you can intercept and log.
Error handling and logging

Look at the block(s) where sgMail.send(msg) is called.
Ensure you capture and log any rejected promises or caught exceptions so you can see whether SendGrid is returning an error.
Make sure the function returns a resolved promise or some status in the routes so you can debug if it’s failing before or after the send call.
Token generation and usage

Verify the code that generates the verification token is producing a valid token that is appended (or otherwise included) in the email.
Ensure the token is used consistently between the verification route and the email link.
3. Endpoint & Router (server/routes.ts)
Endpoint trigger

Make sure the endpoint that triggers sending the verification email is actually being called after user registration. (Sometimes you might be missing a return or await that prevents the function from firing.)
Confirm the route is accessible and spelled the same in both the server route definition and client code.
Correct usage of email sending function

Verify that the route properly calls your sendVerificationEmail (or equivalent function) from server/utils/email.ts with all required parameters.
If you’re passing user data or token data, ensure it is valid and that no optional parameters are incorrectly set to undefined.
Verification endpoint

If you are testing with a local environment or test user sign-up, ensure that the link or token from the email is pointing to the correct verification endpoint.
Although this is more about verification, sometimes if the token generation fails, the email never gets sent at all.
