It's important to consider copper intake in relation to zinc supplementation, as high levels of zinc can affect copper absorption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The current supplement regimen shows no significant physiological effects based on user reports. Adjustments, including potential copper supplementation, should be discussed with a healthcare provider, particularly considering the existing supplements and overall mineral balance.\n\n[3/14/2025]\n### Supplement Summary for March 14, 2025\n\n**Supplements Taken:**\n- **Creatine**: 5 mg\n- **Borage Oil (General)**: 1 g\n- **Bacopa (General)**: 1 mg\n- **Zinc**: 10 mg\n- **Boron Glycinate**: 5 mg\n- **Vitamin B5**: 1 mg\n\n**Effects Reported:** \n- No effects recorded for any of the supplements on this day.\n\n**Qualitative Observations:**\n- No qualitative experiences noted.\n\n### Summary:\nOn March 14, 2025, the user took six different supplements, but there were no recorded effects or qualitative experiences linked to their intake. This lack of perceived effects suggests either a stable baseline or that these particular dosages did not elicit noticeable changes on this day.\n\n\n\nUser Query:\nHow much fish oil should someone my age take?\n\n"
