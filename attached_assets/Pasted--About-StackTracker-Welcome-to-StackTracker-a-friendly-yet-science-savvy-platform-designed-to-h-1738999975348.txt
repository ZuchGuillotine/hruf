**About StackTracker**  
Welcome to StackTracker—a friendly yet science-savvy platform designed to help you take control of your well-being. We believe that knowledge is power, especially when it comes to your unique health journey. Whether you’re a long-time supplement enthusiast or you’re just getting started, StackTracker makes it easy to log, reflect on, and optimize every aspect of your supplement regimen.

**What StackTracker Does**  
- **Streamlined Tracking:** StackTracker’s intuitive interface lets you record your supplement regimen with just a few taps. Log dosage, frequency, and timing to keep an accurate record of your daily intake.  
- **Qualitative Insights:** Beyond the numbers, StackTracker helps you capture how your supplements are truly making you feel. From energy levels and mood to sleep quality, you can track it all and watch for patterns over time.  
- **Intelligent Feedback:** Tap into a customized knowledge base that learns from your personal data. The StackTracker platform takes your unique health info into account so you can ask questions and receive tailored insights that make sense for *you*—no more one-size-fits-all advice.

**Why It Matters**  
When it comes to health, personalization is everything. We’re all different, and what works wonders for one person might not work for another. By marrying hard data (like dosage and timing) with your subjective experience (how you feel physically and emotionally), StackTracker gives you the full story behind your supplement use. You’ll discover what genuinely benefits you and what might need adjusting.

StackTracker was built with a user-first approach, creating a sleek interface that’s easy to navigate on any device. Think of it as your personal supplement journal—always up-to-date, always ready to offer meaningful insights.
