### Chat Systems Architecture

#### Qualitative Feedback Chat
- **Purpose**: Gather user observations about supplement experiences and provide personalized feedback
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Component: LLMChat (qualitative feedback specific)
  - Database: type='chat' in qualitative_logs for feedback conversations
  - Context: constructUserContext specifically for supplement feedback
  - Hook: useLLM for managing feedback chat state
- **Storage Conventions**:
  - Chat content stored with metadata.type = 'chat'
  - Feedback conversations tagged with ['ai_conversation']
  - Saved chats include timestamp in metadata.savedAt
- **Data Flow**:
  - User input → llmContextService.ts → OpenAI → qualitative_logs table
  - Displayed in Daily Notes section of supplement history page
  - Included in context for future conversations
  - Summarized periodically by llmSummaryService

#### General Query Chat
- **Purpose**: Provide factual information about supplements without affecting daily logs
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Component: AskPage (general query specific)
  - Database: separate query_chats table (not qualitative_logs)
  - Context: constructQueryContext specifically for supplement information
  - Controller: queryController for handling query requests
- **Storage Conventions**:
  - Messages stored as JSONB in query_chats.messages
  - Query text stored in metadata.query
  - Timestamps tracked in createdAt/updatedAt fields
- **Data Flow**:
  - User query → llmContextService_query.ts → OpenAI → query_chats table
  - Not displayed in Daily Notes section
  - Not included in feedback chat context
  - Provides authentication-aware responses (personalized for logged-in users)

#### Separation Logic
- Feedback chats (qualitative_logs) displayed in history view, query chats are not
- Daily Notes section filters out type='query' entries
- Query chats use separate database table query_chats
- Different context building services for different purposes
- Different UI components for different chat types

## Query Interface Authentication Troubleshooting (March 2025)

### Authentication Issue Overview
A persistent issue was encountered with the query interface not properly recognizing authenticated users, preventing personalized context retrieval and chat history saving.

### Troubleshooting Timeline and Approaches

1. **Initial Middleware Investigation**
   - Added extensive debug logging throughout auth middleware
   - Traced auth flow from initial request through middleware chain
   - Identified potential timing issues with passport initialization
   - Discovered multiple requests being processed before auth was fully established

2. **Authentication Check Approaches**
   - Tested various ways to check user authentication status:
     - Optional chaining with `req.isAuthenticated?.()`
     - Direct access via `req.isAuthenticated()`
     - Session inspection with `req.user` validation
   - Identified inconsistent auth state between different routes

3. **Context Service Parameter Type Issues**
   - Found parameter type mismatch in `llmContextService_query.ts`
   - Changed `userId` type from `string | null` to `number | null`
   - Aligned authentication check in query routes with rest of application

4. **Code Cleanup**
   - Removed excessive auth logging that was causing performance issues
   - Streamlined middleware to follow best practices
   - Simplified auth check in `queryRoutes.ts`

### Root Causes Identified
1. Type inconsistency: The query context service expected a string ID but the system uses numeric IDs
2. Authentication method: Inconsistent usage of `req.isAuthenticated()`  
3. Optional chaining causing unexpected behavior when checking auth status

### Lessons Learned
- Authentication checks should be consistent across the entire application
- Type safety is critical for proper user identification
- Excessive middleware and logging can obscure actual issues
- Authentication should be verified at the service level, not just route level
