## OpenAI o-Series Models and Web Development Tools

### OpenAI o-Series Overview
The o-series models (including gpt-4o-mini which we use) represent a fundamental shift in LLM design, featuring:
- Enhanced reasoning with "private chain of thought" processing
- Improved accuracy and safety at the cost of slower response times
- Better performance on complex tasks (e.g., 83% on IMO vs 13% for previous models)
- Stronger resistance to jailbreaking through deliberative processing
