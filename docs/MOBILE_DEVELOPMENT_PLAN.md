# HRUF Mobile Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to extend the HRUF (Health & Research User Feedback) web application to iOS and Android platforms using React Native and Expo, while maintaining the existing web application without disruption.

**Status**: ✅ Foundation Complete | 🚧 Implementation Phase

---

## Initial Plan & Strategic Approach

### Core Strategy
- **Framework**: Expo + React Native (managed workflow)
- **Repository**: Monorepo with `mobile-alpha` branch isolation
- **Code Sharing**: 85%+ business logic reuse through shared packages
- **Timeline**: 7-week development cycle to app store submission

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared packages + platform-specific apps
- **Design System**: NativeWind for consistent styling with Tailwind tokens
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **Charts**: Victory Native replacing web-only Recharts
- **Payments**: StoreKit 2 (iOS) + Google Play Billing + Stripe webhook sync

---

## ✅ Accomplished Tasks (Week 0-1)

### Repository & Branch Management
- [x] Created `mobile-alpha` branch isolated from `main` 
- [x] Set up monorepo workspace structure
- [x] All mobile development safely isolated from production web app

### Foundation Architecture
- [x] **Expo App Scaffolding**: React Native TypeScript app in `mobile/`
- [x] **Shared Packages Created**:
  - `@hruf/shared-types`: Database schemas, type definitions, Zod validation
  - `@hruf/utils`: Pure utility functions (date, string, math, validation)
  - `@hruf/api`: ✅ **NEW** Platform-agnostic API layer with dual auth support
- [x] **Codebase Analysis**: Confirmed 85%+ code reuse potential

### Package Structure Established
```

├── mobile/                    # React Native Expo app
├── packages/
│   ├── shared-types/         # DB schemas & types
│   ├── utils/                # Pure utility functions  
│   └── api/                  # ✅ HTTP client & API endpoints
├── client/                   # Web app (unchanged)
├── server/                   # Backend (unchanged)
└── docs/                     # Documentation
```

## ✅ **NEW: Recent Session Progress (Current)**

### Critical Infrastructure Completed
- [x] **Fixed Package Build Issues**: @hruf/utils package now builds correctly
- [x] **Mobile Dependencies Installed**: NativeWind, React Navigation, Victory Native, Expo Router, TanStack Query
- [x] **Mobile Configuration Files**: babel.config.js, metro.config.js, tailwind.config.js
- [x] **Shared API Package**: Complete platform-agnostic API layer with dual authentication

### Mobile App Architecture Decisions
- [x] **Card-Based Dashboard Strategy**: Confirmed mobile dashboard will use navigation cards instead of cramming web layout
- [x] **Screen Separation**: AI Chat, Supplements, Labs, Health Stats will be dedicated screens
- [x] **Native Patterns**: Bottom tab navigation and native mobile UX patterns
- [x] **Workspace Integration**: Mobile app configured to consume shared packages

### API Package Features Completed
- [x] **Dual Authentication**: Session-based (web) + token-based (mobile) auth
- [x] **Complete Endpoint Coverage**: Auth, supplements, chat/LLM, labs, health stats, admin
- [x] **TanStack Query Integration**: Pre-built hooks for all API operations
- [x] **Platform Factories**: `createWebApi()` and `createMobileApi()` with auto-detection
- [x] **Streaming Support**: SSE chat integration for both platforms
- [x] **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage

- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on web and mobile simultaneously

---

## Collaboration Guidelines

### For Human Developers
1. **Web Development**: Continue on `main` branch as normal
2. **Mobile Development**: Work exclusively on `mobile-alpha` branch
3. **Shared Code**: Test changes in both web and mobile contexts
4. **Integration**: Regular merges from `main` to `mobile-alpha` for updates

### For AI Agents
```bash
# Always verify branch before starting work
git branch --show-current

# Mobile work: ensure on mobile-alpha
git checkout mobile-alpha

# Web work: ensure on main  
git checkout main

# Shared package development
cd packages/[package-name]
npm run build && npm run test
```

### Critical Constraints
- **Never modify web app** when working on mobile features
- **Always commit to mobile-alpha** for mobile-related changes
- **Test shared packages** in both web and mobile contexts
- **Document breaking changes** in shared package CHANGELOGs

## 🚩 Findings from Initial Expo Test (Week 1.5)

#### Observed Issues
- Test build auto-logged into a **fake demo account** created by a collaborator.
- Authentication & API calls were **not exercised against the real backend** in Expo dev mode.
- Mobile UI diverges significantly from web app styling – lacks Tailwind tokens, consistent colors, and component density.
- **No landing / onboarding flow**: app boots directly into the dashboard of the demo user.

#### Impact
These gaps hide critical bugs in auth, networking, and user-journey; they must be resolved before continuing feature work.

### 📌 Plan Adjustments & Action Items
1. **Real Backend Integration**
   - [ ] Disable demo account auto-login and seed scripts.
   - [ ] Configure environment switching for mobile to point to the local backend (AWS App Runner tunnel / LAN IP) in dev.
   - [ ] Verify token-based auth, session refresh, and SSE streaming on both iOS and Android.

2. **Onboarding & Landing Screens**
   - [ ] Build a mobile landing page with branding and a “Get Started” CTA.
   - [ ] Implement multi-step onboarding cards (profile, health stats, supplements).
   - [ ] Route unauthenticated users to onboarding; authenticated users → dashboard.

3. **UI/UX Alignment with Web**
   - [ ] Export Tailwind design tokens from the web app and import them into the NativeWind theme.
   - [ ] Create a set of shadcn/ui-equivalent components for React Native.
   - [ ] Standardize spacing, typography, palette, and dark-mode support across screens.

4. **Dev Networking & Environment**
   - [ ] Add a `npm run dev:tunnel` script (ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel) to expose the local App Runner backend.
   - [ ] Document RDS temporary public access and required IP whitelisting.
   - [ ] Provide a `.env.mobile.example` file with API endpoints and third-party keys (lab processor, OpenAI).

5. **Regression Checklist**
   - [ ] Validate auth, supplement CRUD, lab uploads, and AI chat against real data.
   - [ ] Confirm friendly error states for offline and API failures.
   - [ ] Ensure crash-free sessions on iOS device/simulator and Android emulator.

These items are promoted to the **top of Phase 1.5** and must be completed before advancing to Phase 2.

## 🔧 Critical Troubleshooting Solutions

### React Hook Conflict Resolution (SOLVED)

**Problem**: "Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component" errors preventing Expo app from starting.

**Root Cause**: Multiple React instances in monorepo:
- Root workspace: React 19.1.0
- Mobile app: React 19.0.0  
- Expo CLI canary: React 19.2.0-canary

**Solution Applied**:

1. **Exact Version Alignment**: Force React 19.0.0 across entire monorepo
   ```json
   // package.json resolutions
   "resolutions": {
     "react": "19.0.0",
     "react-dom": "19.0.0", 
     "@types/react": "19.0.10",
     "@types/react-dom": "19.0.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Metro Configuration**: Force React resolution from workspace root
   ```js
   // mobile/metro.config.js
   config.resolver.alias = {
     'react': path.resolve(workspaceRoot, 'node_modules/react'),
     'react-native': path.resolve(projectRoot, 'node_modules/react-native'),
   };
   ```

3. **Physical Cleanup**: Remove duplicate React instances
   ```bash
   rm -rf mobile/node_modules/react
   rm -rf mobile/node_modules/react-dom
   ```

4. **Package Updates**: Align all shared packages to React 19.0.0
   - `packages/api/package.json`: React 18.3.1 → 19.0.0
   - `packages/core/package.json`: React 18.3.1 → 19.0.0

**Verification**: Expo now starts successfully on port 8089 without React hook errors.

**Key Learnings**:
- Expo SDK 53 requires exact React 19.0.0 compatibility
- Metro alias is more reliable than blockList for React resolution
- Monorepo workspaces require careful dependency version management
- Always run from mobile/ directory: `cd mobile && npx expo start`
