# StackTracker AWS Migration & Monorepo Transition Plan (High‑Level)

> **Goal** – Move the live StackTracker web app from Replit to AWS (Elastic Beanstalk + RDS PostgreSQL), while restructuring the codebase into a Turbo/Nx monorepo that will later power iOS & Android builds via Expo. The cut‑over must avoid user‑visible downtime and preserve all current functionality.

## Verification Steps (Post-Deployment)

### 1. Infrastructure Verification
```bash
# Check CloudFormation stack status
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name StackTrackerInfraStackV2

# Verify RDS instance
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <instance-id>

# Test S3 bucket access
aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>
```

### 2. Database Connectivity Test
```bash
# Get database credentials from Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id stacktracker/db-credentials-v3

# Test connection (from within VPC)
psql -h <rds-endpoint> -U stacktracker_admin -d stacktracker

# Verify pgvector extension
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';
```

### 3. Application Configuration Updates
```typescript
// Update database configuration
const dbConfig = {
  host: process.env.RDS_ENDPOINT,
  port: 5432,
  database: 'stacktracker',
  // Use Secrets Manager for credentials
}

// Update S3 configuration
const s3Config = {
  bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET_NAME,
  region: 'us-west-2'
}
```

## 0 · Prerequisites & Assumptions

* Small active user base (<100) ⇒ brief read‑only window is acceptable but strive for 0‑downtime.
* AWS account, Route 53, and Apple/Google developer accounts are already provisioned.
* Current Postgres data on Replit can be exported with `pg_dump`.
* CI provider is GitHub Actions (can be swapped later).

---

## 1 · Branch Strategy

1. **Create long‑lived branch** `migration/aws-monorepo` off `main`.
2. Protect `main`; all prod deploys continue via Replit until final cut‑over.
3. Periodically merge `main` → `migration` to stay up to date.

---

## 2 · Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

> **Folder:** `/infra`
> | Stack | Service | Notes |
> |-------|---------|-------|
> | **VPC** | 2 public + 2 private + 2 isolated subnets | ✅ Deployed with proper network segmentation |
> | **DB** | **RDS PostgreSQL 15.8** | ✅ Deployed with pgvector extension support |
> | **Compute** | **Elastic Beanstalk (EB)** | ⏳ Pending - Docker platform configuration |
> | **Storage** | S3 bucket (auto-generated name) | ✅ Deployed with versioning and CORS |
> | **Secrets** | AWS Secrets Manager | ✅ Deployed - stores DB credentials |
> | **Monitoring** | CloudWatch Logs + Alarms | ⏳ Pending - Will monitor EB and RDS |

Use **CloudFormation or AWS CDK** to template the above. Ship a `staging` stack first, followed by `prod`.

---

## 3 · Monorepo Scaffolding

```
/
├ apps/
│  ├ web/        # existing Vite/Express app
│  └ mobile/     # Expo placeholder
├ packages/
│  ├ ui/         # shared RN + web components
│  └ core/       # api clients, hooks, utils
├ infra/         # IaC code
├ turbo.json
├ package.json   # workspaces
└ tsconfig.json
```

1. Enable **pnpm or Yarn workspaces**.
2. Add Turbo tasks: `build`, `lint`, `test`, `deploy:web`.
3. Move current code into `apps/web`; fix paths.

---

## 4 · Containerization & EB

1. Add multi‑stage **Dockerfile** in `apps/web` (Node 20 Alpine).
2. `Dockerrun.aws.json` for EB or set platform to *Docker*.
3. EB environment variables map → Secrets Manager.
4. Configure EB health check to `/_health`.

---

## 5 · CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

| Job            | Trigger                | Key Steps                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `build-web`    | push → `migration/*`   | Turbo cache → Docker build → push to ECR `staging`. |
| `deploy-web`   | success of `build-web` | Update EB environment via CLI; wait for green.      |
| `db-migrate`   | after deploy           | Run `drizzle-kit push` against RDS.                 |
| `promote-prod` | tag `v*` on `main`     | Same build, deploy to **prod** EB.                  |
| `mobile-build` | on‑demand              | `eas build --platform all` (later phase).           |

---

## 6 · Data Migration

1. Put Replit DB in **read‑only** mode.
2. `pg_dump` → `pg_restore` into RDS.
3. Update EB env vars to RDS endpoint; restart.
4. Smoke‑test staging.
5. Re‑enable writes.

---

## 7 · Cut‑Over / Production Switch

1. Lower DNS TTL to 60 seconds (24 h prior).
2. Merge `migration` → `main`; pipeline deploys to **prod** EB.
3. Validate ALB health checks, Stripe webhooks.
4. Switch Route 53 record to EB ALB.
5. Monitor logs & metrics for 30 minutes; rollback via previous EB version if needed.

---

## 8 · Mobile Roll‑Out (Post‑Migration)

1. Scaffold `apps/mobile` via **Expo TS** template.
2. Consume `packages/ui` components.
3. Configure `.env.*` for API base URL & publishable keys.
4. Integrate Apple/Google sign‑in (if required).
5. Build with **EAS Build**; TestFlight & internal testing.
6. Submit to App Store & Play Store.
7. Link store listings to privacy policy (hosted on website).

---

## 9 · Risk Mitigation & Rollback

* Keep Replit deployment live until DNS cut‑over.
* Automated snapshots on RDS pre & post‑migration.
* Use EB blue/green deployments for zero‑downtime swap.
* Feature‑flag any new code paths touching S3 or Redis.

---

## 10 · Post‑Migration Hardening

* Enable RDS Multi‑AZ & backups.
* Add WAF to ALB, rate‑limit auth routes.
* Set up daily ECS/EB image scans.
* Expand synthetic monitoring (Pingdom) to global POPs.

## AWS Migration & Infrastructure Update (May 2025)

### Key Resource Names
- **VPC**: vpc-0bfbc6bce446d4ced (`stacktracker-vpc-v3`)
- **Public Subnets**: 
  - subnet-0a4c0264355eda44e (us-west-2a)
  - subnet-04b101642ee61aa20 (us-west-2b)
- **Migration RDS Instance**: `stacktracker-migration-db`
- **Migration Subnet Group**: `stacktracker-migration-subnet-group`
- **Parameter Group**: `stacktracker-migration-param-group`
- **Security Group**: sg-033417a7d86b9a062
- **PostgreSQL Version**: 17.5

### Migration Steps (Updated)
1. Create a new RDS instance (`stacktracker-migration-db`) in the public subnets using the above subnet group and parameter group, with PostgreSQL 17.5.
2. Allow your IP address in the security group (sg-033417a7d86b9a062) for port 5432.
3. Perform the migration using `pg_restore`.
4. **After migration is verified:**
   - Modify the RDS instance to use the private/isolated subnet group.
   - Remove your IP from the security group.
   - Set the RDS instance to not be publicly accessible.

### Security Reminder
- **IMPORTANT:** Publicly accessible RDS instances are at risk of attack. Only enable public access for the duration of the migration, and restrict access to your IP.
- After migration, always revert the RDS instance to private subnets and remove public access/security group rules.

### How to Revert Public Access
1. In the AWS Console or CLI, modify the RDS instance to use the private/isolated subnet group.
2. Set `PubliclyAccessible` to `false`.
3. Remove any security group rules allowing your public IP.
4. Verify that the database is only accessible from within the VPC (e.g., from EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk).
