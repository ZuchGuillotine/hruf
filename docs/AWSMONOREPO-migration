# StackTracker AWS Migration & Monorepo Transition Plan (High‑Level)

> **Goal** – Move the live StackTracker web app from Replit to AWS (Elastic Beanstalk + RDS PostgreSQL), while restructuring the codebase into a Turbo/Nx monorepo that will later power iOS & Android builds via Expo. The cut‑over must avoid user‑visible downtime and preserve all current functionality.

---

## Implementation Status (Updated)

### Completed ✅
1. **AWS Account Setup**
   - Created IAM user with custom policy for infrastructure deployment
   - Configured AWS CLI credentials
   - Bootstrapped CDK environment

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Initialized CDK project in `/infra` directory
   - Created VPC infrastructure stack with:
     - Public subnets (10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24) for load balancers
     - Private subnets (10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24) for application servers
     - Isolated subnets (10.0.4.0/24, 10.0.5.0/24) for databases
     - NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access
     - VPC endpoints for S3, Secrets Manager, and RDS
     - Security groups for database and application tiers

### In Progress 🚧
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - [ ] RDS instance configuration with pgvector
   - [ ] S3 bucket setup for uploads
   - [ ] Elastic Beanstalk environment
   - [ ] Secrets Manager configuration

### Pending ⏳
1. **Monorepo Restructuring**
   - [ ] Move current code into `apps/web`
   - [ ] Set up shared packages
   - [ ] Configure Turbo tasks

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - [ ] GitHub Actions workflow setup
   - [ ] Docker build configuration
   - [ ] Deployment automation

3. **Data Migration**
   - [ ] Database backup strategy
   - [ ] Migration testing
   - [ ] Cut-over planning

4. **Mobile App Setup**
   - [ ] Expo project initialization
   - [ ] Shared component library
   - [ ] Mobile-specific configurations

## 0 · Prerequisites & Assumptions

* Small active user base (<100) ⇒ brief read‑only window is acceptable but strive for 0‑downtime.
* AWS account, Route 53, and Apple/Google developer accounts are already provisioned.
* Current Postgres data on Replit can be exported with `pg_dump`.
* CI provider is GitHub Actions (can be swapped later).

---

## 1 · Branch Strategy

1. **Create long‑lived branch** `migration/aws-monorepo` off `main`.
2. Protect `main`; all prod deploys continue via Replit until final cut‑over.
3. Periodically merge `main` → `migration` to stay up to date.

---

## 2 · Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

> **Folder:** `/infra`
> | Stack | Service | Notes |
> |-------|---------|-------|
> | **VPC** | 2 public + 2 private + 2 isolated subnets | ✅ Implemented with proper network segmentation |
> | **DB** | **RDS PostgreSQL 15** | 🚧 Pending - Will include pgvector extension |
> | **Compute** | **Elastic Beanstalk (EB)** | 🚧 Pending - Docker platform configuration |
> | **Storage** | S3 bucket `stacktracker‑uploads‑<env>` | 🚧 Pending - Will include versioning and CORS |
> | **Secrets** | AWS Secrets Manager | 🚧 Pending - Will store DB creds, API keys |
> | **Monitoring** | CloudWatch Logs + Alarms | ⏳ Pending - Will monitor EB and RDS |

Use **CloudFormation or AWS CDK** to template the above. Ship a `staging` stack first, followed by `prod`.

---

## 3 · Monorepo Scaffolding

```
/
├ apps/
│  ├ web/        # existing Vite/Express app
│  └ mobile/     # Expo placeholder
├ packages/
│  ├ ui/         # shared RN + web components
│  └ core/       # api clients, hooks, utils
├ infra/         # IaC code
├ turbo.json
├ package.json   # workspaces
└ tsconfig.json
```

1. Enable **pnpm or Yarn workspaces**.
2. Add Turbo tasks: `build`, `lint`, `test`, `deploy:web`.
3. Move current code into `apps/web`; fix paths.

---

## 4 · Containerization & EB

1. Add multi‑stage **Dockerfile** in `apps/web` (Node 20 Alpine).
2. `Dockerrun.aws.json` for EB or set platform to *Docker*.
3. EB environment variables map → Secrets Manager.
4. Configure EB health check to `/_health`.

---

## 5 · CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

| Job            | Trigger                | Key Steps                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `build-web`    | push → `migration/*`   | Turbo cache → Docker build → push to ECR `staging`. |
| `deploy-web`   | success of `build-web` | Update EB environment via CLI; wait for green.      |
| `db-migrate`   | after deploy           | Run `drizzle-kit push` against RDS.                 |
| `promote-prod` | tag `v*` on `main`     | Same build, deploy to **prod** EB.                  |
| `mobile-build` | on‑demand              | `eas build --platform all` (later phase).           |

---

## 6 · Data Migration

1. Put Replit DB in **read‑only** mode.
2. `pg_dump` → `pg_restore` into RDS.
3. Update EB env vars to RDS endpoint; restart.
4. Smoke‑test staging.
5. Re‑enable writes.

---

## 7 · Cut‑Over / Production Switch

1. Lower DNS TTL to 60 seconds (24 h prior).
2. Merge `migration` → `main`; pipeline deploys to **prod** EB.
3. Validate ALB health checks, Stripe webhooks.
4. Switch Route 53 record to EB ALB.
5. Monitor logs & metrics for 30 minutes; rollback via previous EB version if needed.

---

## 8 · Mobile Roll‑Out (Post‑Migration)

1. Scaffold `apps/mobile` via **Expo TS** template.
2. Consume `packages/ui` components.
3. Configure `.env.*` for API base URL & publishable keys.
4. Integrate Apple/Google sign‑in (if required).
5. Build with **EAS Build**; TestFlight & internal testing.
6. Submit to App Store & Play Store.
7. Link store listings to privacy policy (hosted on website).

---

## 9 · Risk Mitigation & Rollback

* Keep Replit deployment live until DNS cut‑over.
* Automated snapshots on RDS pre & post‑migration.
* Use EB blue/green deployments for zero‑downtime swap.
* Feature‑flag any new code paths touching S3 or Redis.

---

## 10 · Post‑Migration Hardening

* Enable RDS Multi‑AZ & backups.
* Add WAF to ALB, rate‑limit auth routes.
* Set up daily ECS/EB image scans.
* Expand synthetic monitoring (Pingdom) to global POPs.
