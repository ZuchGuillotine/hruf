# HIPAA-Compliant Supplement Tracking Application

## Project Overview
A cutting-edge health tracking and content management application that combines intelligent health recommendations with robust user experience features. The application provides secure, comprehensive health supplement tracking and AI-powered content creation tools with a focus on user privacy, data integrity, and seamless interaction.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database Architecture**:
  - **Consolidated Database (NeonDB)**:
    - All database tables are now stored in NeonDB Postgres
    - Previous RDS dependency has been removed
    - Complete database architecture including user data, supplements, logs, and chat interactions

## Dual AI Chat Systems
The application includes two specialized chat interfaces for different user needs:

### 1. Qualitative Feedback Chat System
For gathering detailed user feedback about supplement experiences:

#### Data Flow
1. User initiates feedback through the chat interface
2. System constructs context from:
   - User health statistics (weight, height, allergies, etc.)
   - Recent supplement logs (quantitative data)
   - Previous qualitative observations
3. AI assistant engages user with relevant follow-up questions
4. Responses are stored in qualitative_logs table with type='chat'
5. Users can save meaningful conversations for future reference

#### Technical Components
- Frontend: LLMChat component in llm-chat.tsx
- Backend: llmContextService.ts for context construction
- Database: qualitative_logs table with chat-specific metadata

### 2. General Supplement Query System
For answering factual questions about supplements:

#### Data Flow
1. User submits question via the Ask page
2. System constructs specialized context from:
   - User health statistics (if authenticated)
   - User's supplement history (if authenticated)
   - Different system prompt focused on factual information
3. AI assistant provides evidence-based information
4. Authenticated users receive personalized responses considering their health context
5. Non-authenticated users receive general information

#### Technical Components
- Frontend: AskPage component in ask.tsx
- Backend: llmContextService_query.ts for context construction
- Database: Same database tables but with query-specific context building
  - **Consolidated Database (NeonDB)**:
    - User authentication and profiles
    - Health statistics
    - Blog content management
    - Supplement selections and tracking
    - Chat interaction history
    - Supplement reference data
    - Daily supplement logs
- **Authentication**: 
  - Passport.js with session-based auth
  - Google OAuth integration (currently in troubleshooting)
- **AI Integration**: 
  - OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for intelligent health insights
  - Functional with planned enhancements for streaming responses
  - System prompt refinements in progress
  - Additional context integration being developed
- **Email Service**: SendGrid for verification emails (functional with basic features)
- **Development Tools**: Drizzle ORM, TanStack Query, Wouter routing

## Data Flow Architecture
### Supplement Management Flow:
- User selections stored in supplements table
- Daily tracking stored in supplement_logs table
- Card operations (add/edit/delete) update supplements table
- "Save Changes" button triggers supplement_logs entry

### Database Integration Flow:
- Supplement card data managed in supplements table
- Save operation triggers data storage in supplement_logs
- History view combines data from unified database:
  - Logs from supplement_logs table
  - Notes from interactions stored in qualitative_logs table
