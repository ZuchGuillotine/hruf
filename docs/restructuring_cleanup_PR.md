+# Restructuring & Clean-Up Pull-Request â€“ Progress Tracker (June 01 2025)
+
+This PR documents the incremental refactor that converts our Replit-era codebase into a clean Turbo monorepo ready for AWS deployment and mobile expansion.
+
+## âœ…  Completed in this PR
+
+1. **Created workspace `packages/backend`**  
+   â€“ Moved `services/`, `cron/`, `utils/`, `types/`, `lib/`, `config/` out of `apps/web/server`.  
+   â€“ Added barrel export `packages/backend/src/index.ts`.
+
+2. **Hoisted path-alias architecture**  
+   â€“ Root `tsconfig.json` now exposes `@core/*`, `@core/db/*`, `@backend/*`, `@services/*`.  
+   â€“ All package tsconfigs inherit these aliases; `apps/web` references backend.
+
+3. **Build & dev script updates**  
+   â€“ `tsx -r tsconfig-paths/register` for dev server.  
+   â€“ `esbuild` production bundle now supplied `--tsconfig`.
+
+4. **Code-mod import migration**  
+   â€“ Rewrote `../services/*` â†’ `@services/*`.  
+   â€“ Fixed stray `from /module'` typos after regex passes.
+
+5. **Repository hygiene**  
+   â€“ Deleted committed `apps/mobile/node_modules`, `package.json.backup`, misc artefacts.  
+   â€“ Removed obsolete root `src/`.
+
+6. **TypeScript fixes**  
+   â€“ Exported `AuthState` in mobile auth slice.  
+   â€“ Re-implemented `LimitReachedNotification` with internal UI library rather than Chakra.
+
+## ğŸš§  Still to address (will be follow-up commits)
+
+1. Replace or exclude placeholder stub components in `packages/shared-components/src/components/**` that currently break `tsc`.
+2. Update remaining dynamic `await import('/stripe')` style strings in middleware/routes.
+3. Re-enable full `npm run check` once the above compile blockers are cleared.
+4. Rebuild CI pipeline to include new backend workspace.

+
+> **Reviewer Tips**  
+> â€¢ Focus your review on alias correctness (`@services/*` should always originate from backend).  
+> â€¢ Ignore the stub component compilation errors for now â€“ they'll disappear once the components are finished or excluded.  
+> â€¢ End-to-end test: `npm run dev` starts server; web UI should load; unit tests under `packages/backend` pass with `npm run test:services`.
