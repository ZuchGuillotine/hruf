  - Enhanced user experience with proper form value retention
### Enhanced
- Improved chat message display in supplement history:
  - Added personalized username display instead of generic "user" label
  - Enhanced message attribution clarity
  - Improved user identification in chat history
### Fixed
- Resolved critical timezone and date display issues in supplement tracking:
  - Fixed supplement logs appearing one day ahead in history view
  - Corrected timestamp preservation for supplement intake logs
  - Fixed incorrect fixed time (4:00) display issue
  - Implemented proper UTC day boundary handling for date queries

### Changed
- Enhanced timezone handling across the application:
  - Client-side:
    - Modified supplement logging to preserve exact intake timestamps
    - Removed UTC noon timestamp normalization
    - Added detailed logging for timestamp debugging
  - Server-side:
    - Implemented UTC day boundary calculations
    - Switched from DATE() casting to direct timestamp comparisons
    - Added comprehensive timezone-aware date handling
    - Enhanced logging for better debugging capabilities

### Technical Details
If similar issues occur in the future, here's how to fix them:

1. Timestamp Preservation:
   - Always use `toISOString()` for timestamps
   - Don't normalize times to noon or any fixed time
   - Preserve original intake times throughout the system

2. Date Querying:
   - Use UTC day boundaries for date range queries
   - Calculate start/end of day in UTC:
     ```typescript
     const startOfDay = new Date(`
