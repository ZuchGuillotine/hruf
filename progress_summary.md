   - Fallback to Trie-based fuzzy search for better matching
   - Efficient caching of supplement reference data
   - Hybrid search approach:
     - Database-first for exact matches
     - Trie-based search for fuzzy matching
     - Support for custom supplement names

3. Database Structure
   - Supplement reference table for standard supplements
   - User-specific supplement table for custom entries
   - Optimized indices for search performance
   - Tracking data schema for supplement intake
